This is a test repo to put a project online using GitHub Pages (deploy a website)
First, make a public repository, then add some file (in case index.html), then commit
The website is available at https://anettdori.github.io

GitHub Pages essentially connects the repository to a unique URL so that, when you go to that URL in your browser, youâ€™ll find your website displayed.
